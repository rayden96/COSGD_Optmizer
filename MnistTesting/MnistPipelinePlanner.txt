This serves as the planning document for testing COSGD on the Mnist dataset along with all the different experiments

Clustering Phase and statistics:
1. record clustering method, number of clusters and how it was tuned, statistics on the clustering:
    - Label spread for clusters
    - Big O notation
    - Time taken to cluster

Clustering choice:
1. What method choice
    - hyper parameter tuning
    - comparisons against other clustering

Model Training:
1. We aim to speed up training
    - evaluation multiple times over set of epochs
    - compare against control (and other COSGD models)
    - time comparison of training
    - model size comparison

2. We aim to prevent catastrophic forgetting
    - only train on some of the data and then retrain
    - compare against EWC and newer techniques

3. Hyper parameter evaluation and model architecture evaluation
    - ablation study
    - impact of changing hyper parameters

4. Post clustering evaluation
    - leaky Orthogonalization
    - dropout Orthogonalization
    - EWC Orthogonalization
